              Liminal Vault Studio creates inset architectural reliefs. Sculptural forms fabricated off-site and installed directly into existing walls.
              Each piece is designed for its space, seated with precision, and finished to feel discovered rather than applied.

        <h2>What We Make</h2>
        <p>
          Inset architectural reliefs are sculptural wall works designed to integrate seamlessly into existing architecture.
          Each piece is custom measured, fabricated in the studio, and installed in a single controlled operation.
        </p>

            <h3>Inset Relief</h3>
            <p>Pre-fabricated relief seated into a measured wall opening and finished to integrate with the surrounding surface.</p>

          <div class="card">
            <h3>Sculptural Installations</h3>
            <p>Larger works designed for interiors where scale and spatial presence are central. Built in sections when needed.</p>

          <div class="card">
            <h3>Relief Panels</h3>
            <p>Smaller scale pieces for clients seeking the language of inset relief without a full custom build.</p>

            <h3>1. Site Visit</h3>

          <div class="card">
            <h3>2. Studio Fabrication</h3>
            <p>All sculptural work is fabricated off-site under controlled conditions for precision and consistency.</p>

          <div class="card">
            <h3>3. Installation</h3>
            <p>Remove a measured drywall section, seat the completed relief, secure, seal, and finish for seamless integration.</p>
